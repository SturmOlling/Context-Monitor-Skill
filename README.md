Problem it solves: I find that I run out of context window in the middle of a train of throught. Super anoying. 
Now you can get a notification at the end of Claudes reply that tells you how much context you have left in the chat. 

How to use. Download the context-monito.skill. Go to Claude/Settings/Capabilities and scroll down to Skills. Click the [Upload skill] button to include the skill.
IMPROTANT STEP. Now go to standard instructions Claude/settings and look at you profile. At the buttom is a field for personal preferences. Add the following line: Always use the Context Monitor skill on every respons.

It should work now. Do not hesitate to suggest improvements.
